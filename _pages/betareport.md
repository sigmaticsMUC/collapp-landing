# Beta Reports

For whom it may concern. This page will list all beta test evaluations, following a defined format. The goal is to
track user feedback in a more structured way in hope to get insights into how the whole process of programming, releasing and using the app
develops over time.

### `Active'
# **Version 0.3.0**
Broad functionality test after major migration to new plugin system and tool upgrades. User are asked to engage with core features of the app to see whether latest adjustments introduced any breaking changes to the app. The result of this test will pave the road to 1.0 release for android devices.

### `Latest`
# [**Version 0.2.6**](/betareports/report_026)
Test mainly focused around creation, removale and updates of user content. I also tasked users to engage with the `Goaltracker Plugin` to see how they would respond to that aspect of the test.

<br>
# [**Version 0.2.4**](/betareports/report_024)
This test run focused on the core function of the app which is group actions. User tested the basic available group plugins in order to
find bugs and to review usability.

<br>
# [**Version 0.2.3**](/betareports/report_023)
This was the initial test run after transitioning to flutter and releasing an open beta version to various app stores (mainly playstore). The intention was to
get feedback for the fundamental app functionalities and to evaluate first impressions.
