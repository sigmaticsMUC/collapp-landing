# Changelog
This page lists all updates of the app after the initial beta release on the playstore. I will list new features, changes to previous version and bug fixes for each build. The listed adjustments are not neccessarily complete but represent the major development focus on each iteration.

<br>

### `Latest`
# **Version 0.2**
This is the beta release version of the app after moving from native implementation towards [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). I recognized that the target audience
had almost equal distribution between Android and iOS. Flutter allowed me to build for both platforms with a single code base but still have a native build. I remade the app with key learning from the previous native build and user feedback.

#### What's New
- Rebuild using [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
- New app ui structure
- Future focus on group plugins

<br>

### `Hotfix`
### **Version 0.2.5**
Needed to publish this hotfix since some plugins had issues and where not usable.

#### What's New
- Introduced categories on feedback plugin.

#### Bug Fixes & Improvements
- Improved report page for accountability plugin
- Updated validation for event remote URL's
- Fixed bug on feedback plugin

<br>

### **Version 0.2.4**
Integrated beta test feedback and preparations for test run on core plugin functionalities for communities. Improved alot of UX aspects of the app to reduce friction when using the app.

#### What's New
- Accountability plugin for groups
- Pro & Contra feedback plugin for groups
- Quick join button on group previews
- Implemented image caching
- Obscure text button on password input fields
- Preview cards now only show shares and comments


#### Bug Fixes & Improvements
- Improved app stability.
- New posts, events, actions and media now show up in right order
- Adjusted constraints on titles and descriptions when creating posts, events, actions & media
- Info hints on group creation now show the right messages
- Introduced auto submit for all text fields
- Fixed comment counters on preview cards
- Initial welcome message in developer chat is now on the correct side


<br>

### **Version 0.2.3**
